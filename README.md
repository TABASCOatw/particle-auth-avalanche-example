    Particle Auth Avalanche Example
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Example for implementing [Particle Auth](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service) within **Avalanche** applications; including user data display, balance retrieval, and other demo functionality.

Built using **Particle Auth**, **TypeScript**, and **Web3.js**

## üîë Particle Auth
Particle Auth, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc.
